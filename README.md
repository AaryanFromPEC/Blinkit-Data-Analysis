# Blinkit Grocery Analytics Dashboard

An endâ€‘toâ€‘end analytics solution built on Blinkitâ€™s grocery transaction data to uncover sales trends, customer behavior and operational insights.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Data Cleaning & Modeling**  
  Raw transaction and product tables were ingested into a PostgreSQL database. Using SQL scripts, data were cleaned, deduplicated and joined into a starâ€‘schema model optimized for reporting.

- **Exploratory Analysis**  
  Leveraged Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) to:
  - Profile key metrics (daily sales, average basket size, product mix)  
  - Identify seasonality, outliers and correlation between spend categories  
  - Generate static charts and summary tables for adâ€‘hoc analysis

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built in **Powerâ€¯BI**, this dashboard features:  
  - KPI cards for total sales, average order value, and repeat purchase rate  
  - Timeâ€‘series and bar charts to compare performance by week, state and product category  
  - Slicers for dynamic filtering by date range, geography and customer segment  
  - Drillâ€‘through reports to inspect granular orderâ€‘level details
